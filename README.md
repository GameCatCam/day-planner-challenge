# 05 Day Planner Challenge

## Description
This application was produced by starter code. But on top of the basic layout of it, I've added features for colors to display based on the time of day relative to the current block. The time displays up at the top of the page and updates live. When text is typed into the different time blocks, it can be saved and will persist between page loads.

## Credits
Most of the code developed in this project was done by me (Cameron Rawlins). Starter code was provided by EdX. Any assistance given on this project was through my instructor Ross Ritchey, through my classmates, or through sites such as MDNWebDocs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).
